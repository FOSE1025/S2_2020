## Activity 1 - Upload files to MATLAB Drive

The following links lead to MATLAB Online. Use them to start MATLAB Online:

* Information about MATLAB licenses for Macquarie University students: https://au.mathworks.com/academia/tah-portal/macquarie-university-916052.html
* Access MATLAB Online: https://matlab.mathworks.com/

Download all following CSV files from this folder:
* [MonthlySalesFiles](MonthlySalesFiles) 
and save them in a MATLAB Drive folder named `MonthlySalesFiles`.

To upload the CSV files into the folder, try the following two options and discuss the advantages and inconveniences of each:

1. Create the folder by interacting with MATLAB Online at https://matlab.mathworks.com.
    1. Create the folder `MonthlySalesFiles` by using the "New" option.
    2. Double-click on the folder to make it active.
    3. Upload the files to MATLAB Drive by using the "upload" option (or clicking and dragging them).
    If the files do not appear in your folder `MonthlySalesFiles`, click and drag them to the right folder.

2. Create the folder by interacting with MATLAB Drive https://drive.matlab.com/:
    1. Create a folder `MonthlySalesFiles` by using the "New Folder" option.
    2. Double-click on the folder to make it active.
    3. Upload the files by using the "Upload" option.
    If the files do not appear in your folder `MATLAB Workshop`, click and drag them to the right folder.

## Activity 2 - Generate a Live Script

Attempt the following tasks:

1. Import the CSV file that holds the January data from the previous exercise into MATLAB. The data must be stored in a variable called `sales_jan`. When importing the data, decide which columns store categorical data and change the column data types from whatever they are set by default to categorical.

2. When you import the data, use the option "Generate Live Script" and examine the resulting script. Do you understand it? Discuss with your peers the meaning or possible meaning of the script.

3. Modify the script so that it now imports the CSV file that holds the February data and saves it into a variable called `sales_feb`.

## Participation task

Save the script that you created in activity 2 and submit it to the week 7 practical 1 participation task submission box.

## OPTIONAL Activity 3 - Use your peer's script

This activity is optional for those who completed activities 1 and 2.

Post your script from activity 2 in the iLearn discussion forum so that other peers can see it. Choose a script posted by a peer.

Use your peer's script to import the March data and save it into a variable called `sales_mar`. Discuss any problems that you encountered and whether/how the script that you received can be improved to solve these problems.

## Activity 1 - Excel to Manage Data in Science

Below is a list of steps that are commonly used to manage data. The list is an extract from one of the slides of the lecture of week 6.

  1. Import data from external files.
  2. Explore the data.
  3. Clean the data.
  4. Preprocess, transform the data.
  5. Analyse, summarise, interpret the data.

In weeks 1 to 5 you have learned some of the basics of Excel that can help you to conduct some of these tasks. Revise what you have learned so far and, for each of steps1, 2 and 5, name at least one way you can use Excel to help you in that step. In particular:

* For step 1: Excel can help you import data from CSV files. Write one way you can do this.
* For step 2: Excel can help you explore the data by filtering and sorting it. Write one way you can do this.
* For step 5: How can Excel help here?

## Activity 2 - Writing Instructions for Peer Review

Choose one of your answers to activity 1 and write specific instructions that would help someone else complete the activity.

Now, exchange your instructions with those of your peer (use the iLearn discussion forum for this) and assess how good they are for reproducibility. Are the instructions clear enough to help you complete the task?

## Participation task

Submit your assessment of your peer's instructions to the week 7 practical 2 participation task submission box.


## OPTIONAL Activity 3 - Git and Github

This activity is optional for those who completed activities 1 and 2.

The lectures have mentioned git and github. These two are related but different technologies to manage software repositories and help collaboration. Answer the following questions by searching the web or based on your own experience:

1. What is the difference between git and github?
2. You can use git outside of github. Give an example of how you could do this.
3. While it could be possible to use github without using git, in practice, normally you would not want to do it. Explain why.
