# Why talk about CT?

- Way of thinking
- Logical approach
- Deterministic \(as opposed to ad\-hoc approach\)

# Target audience

Ages: 0 and above

# Decomposition

Breaking a problem down into sub\-components\.

Identifying aspects\, participants\, processes\.

For example\, decomposing the process of making tea leads us to identifying the ingredients \- water\, tea\, sugar\, milk\, etc and also other entities required like kettle\, stove\, strainer\, pot/cups\.

# Pattern recognition

* Identifying patterns that appear in the domain\. For example\, a pattern in the process of tea is that the best flavours are released when
  * the water is in a specific temperature range \(when tea bags are dunked\)
  * the duration of steeping is within a specific time range\.

# Pattern abstraction

* Applying identified patterns to a wider range of scenarios\.
* For example\, you can extend the following parameters that are there for making one cup of tea for making a larger quantity
  * one tablespoon of tea leaves
  * water at 95 degrees celsius
  * steeping time of 3 minutes

# Algorithm

Given a set of inputs\, a well\-defined \(step\-by\-step\) process to achieve a result\.

An algorithm can be more abstract/generic or more specific/detailed

# Tea algorithm
(Generic)

# Tea algorithm
(Specific)

# Testing

Critical\, yet often overlooked step\, of learning from the outcome to modify the process or even the understanding of the process\.

# Activity - Searching

# Find "ZIGZAG"

# Find "WHAT"

# Find "NICE"

# Search techniques

Random search \(sometimes known as "visual inspection"\)

Linear search \(systematically eliminating items\)

Binary search \(requires ordered/sorted data\)

# ACTIVITY – NUMBER SYSTEMS

# Number Systems

Why decimal?

# Breaking down a number

* 1729 =
  * 1\*1000 \+
  * 7\*100 \+
  * 2\*10 \+
  * 9\*1

* 1729 =
  * 1\*10^3 \+
  * 7\*10^2 \+
  * 2\*10^1 \+
  * 9\*10^0
* Where 10 is the number of symbols in the number system\.
* This representation is called _sum of products_ \.

* 1729 =
  * 1\* _10_ ^3 \+
  * 7\* _10_ ^2 \+
  * 2\* _10_ ^1 \+
  * 9\* _10_ ^0
  * Why is the base of the weight always 10?

# Decimal Number System

* Decomposition: Symbols \(0 to 9\)
* Pattern recognition: Digit\, weight
  * For example\, weight of 7 in 1729 is 100
* Pattern generalization
  * Other number systems

# Breaking down a binary number

* Binary has 2 symbols \(0\, 1\)
* Can you break down the following binary number?
  * 10111

* 10111 =
  * 1\*2^4 \+
  * 0\*2^3 \+
  * 1\*2^2 \+
  * 1\*2^1 \+
  * 1\*2^0
* Where 2 is the number of symbols in the number system\.

# Pattern recognition

* Is 11101010101 a valid binary number?
* What about 11101010201? Why\, or why not?
* What do we learn from this?
  * A base\-N number can only contain symbols 0 to N\-1

# Activity

Pick a number system \(say\, between base\-2 and base\-10\)

Think of a number in that number system

Represent it as sum of products\.
